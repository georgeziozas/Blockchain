# SimpleStorage Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. It also introduces the user to concepts like: smart contract testing, verifying smart contracts programatically on etherscan, pushing on goerli testnet, working with .env variables, creating custom tasks in hardhat, using coverage plugin, using gas reported plugin and much more. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

enjoy.
