    //Besides localhost, Hardhat comes with another pre-defined network: hardhat. This is the same network used by the development node, but instead of starting an HTTP server, itâ€™s an in-process network that is created when you run your task, and killed at the end of it. So if you run hh test --network hardhat, the result will be pretty much equivalent to the combination of starting a new node, running hh test --network localhost, and then killing the node, all in one command.
