'Fund Me' Project aims to introduce newcomers to various more advanced concepts of Solidity like: Receive(),Fallback(), how to withdraw, how to work with chainlink oracles, inheritance, constructors, modifiers and various other interesting topics.

As most of my code files always include comments explaining in detail what everything does, its purpose and how it works.

Check the rest of the depository for it will soon be released from me as a Full Stack Project. 

Written in Solidity ^0.8.8.
